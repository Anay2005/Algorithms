Hi I am Anay.

The topic sentence is the most important sentence 
in a paragraph. It is the main idea of the paragra
ph. It is usually the first sentence, but it can a
ppear at any point in the paragraph. The topic sen
tence is usually a statement that is both general 
and specific. It helps the reader understand what 
the paragraph is about. Often, the body paragraph d
emonstrates and develops your topic sentence throu
gh an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There
are a number of useful techniques for expanding on
topic sentences and developing your ideas in a par
agraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a gen
eral statement by means of examples, details, or r
elevant quotations (with your comments).

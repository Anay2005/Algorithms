Explanation:

Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. 
It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (a kind of hashing). 
Then do some arithmetic operations to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence. 

Algorithm and pseudocode:

countingSort(array, n) // 'n' is the size of array  
max = find maximum element in the given array  
create count array with size maximum + 1  
Initialize count array with all 0's  
for i = 0 to n  
find the count of every unique element and   
store that count at ith position in the count array  
for j = 1 to max  
Now, find the cumulative sum and store it in count array  
for i = n to 1  
Restore the array elements  
Decrease the count of every restored element by 1  
end countingSort  

time complexity - O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of input

Explanation:

The Fibonacci search method, just like the Binary search method, is a comparison-based searching algorithm 
that is based on the divide and conquer technique. 
This search method works on an array that is sorted in the non-decreasing order. 
Before we dive deep into the internals of this search algorithm, 
let’s first understand the Fibonacci numbers.

Fibonacci numbers:

kth fibonnaci number = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
F(k) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

look how it starts at 0 and the next number is the sum of previous two

reccurence relatation: Fₙ =  Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂, n>=2

F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1
F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2
F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3
F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 5
F(6) = 5+3 = 8
